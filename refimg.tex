\section{Introduction}
If you see a point object under water from  above the flat surface of water, 
the position of image depends on the point of view(POV). The image seen
 within a normal plane traces out a specific curve that is called a  
 \emph{squashed astroid} as the POV moves around.

\includegraphics[width=2.7in]{g409.eps}

Let the normal plane that contains the object and  POV be the $xy$-plane,
 and let the intersection of  normal plane and the surface of water be the 
 $x$-axis, and the normal through  object $y$-axis. Then the trace of image 
 is part of the curve 
$$ \left| \dfrac{x}{M} \right| ^ {2/3} 
+ \left| \dfrac{y}{N} \right| ^ {2/3} = 1,$$
where $M = D/\sqrt{n^2 - 1}$ and $N = D/n$, and $D$ is the depth of object
 and $n$ is the index of refraction of the water relative to the air.

\section{Derivation of the formula}
Let the indices of refraction  of air and of water be $n_1$ and $n_2$,
respectively. The point object $O$ is at the depth $D$ below 
the boundary of air and water. A ray starts off the object and enters the boundary of media at 
$\alpha$ away from the $y$-axis with angle $\theta_2$ from the normal at 
that point and then refracts into air with angle $\theta_1$ from the same 
normal.

\includegraphics[width=2.2in]{g237.eps}

From Snell's law we have
$$ \sin\theta_1 = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \sin\theta_2 = n\sin\theta_2.$$
The extension of refracted ray is described by the equation 
$$y=k(x-\alpha),$$
where 
$$k=\dfrac{1}{\tan\theta_1}=\dfrac{\cos\theta_1}{\sin\theta_1},$$
and considering the Snell's law,
$$k=\dfrac{\sqrt{1-n^2\sin^2\theta_2}}{n\sin\theta_2}.$$
This line meets the $y$-axis at $y=\beta$, thus
$$\beta = -k\alpha.$$
By the geometry we have
$$\alpha = D\tan\theta_2 = \dfrac{D\sin\theta_2}{\cos\theta_2},$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
	\beta &= -k\alpha \\
	&= -\dfrac{D\sin\theta_2}{\cos\theta_2}
	\dfrac{\sqrt{1-n^2\sin\theta_2}}{n\sin\theta_2}\\
	&=-\dfrac{D\sqrt{1-n^2\sin\theta_2}}{n\cos\theta_2}.
\end{aligned}$$
Now, let $K=\alpha/M$ and $H=\beta/N$, then
$$ \begin{aligned}
	K^2 + H^2 &= \dfrac{\alpha^2}{M^2}+\dfrac{\beta^2}{N^2}\\
	&=\dfrac{\left(n^2-1\right)\sin^2\theta_2 + 1-n^2\sin^2\theta_2}
	{\cos^2\theta_2}\\
	&=\dfrac{1-\sin^2\theta_2}{\cos^2\theta_2}\\
	&=1
\end{aligned}$$
Let $\xi=x/M$ and $\eta=y/N$, then as the POV moves around in the $xy$-plane,
the points $\mathrm{A}(\alpha, 0)$, and $\mathrm{B}(0, \beta)$ move accordingly,  
and the points $(K, 0)$ and $(0, H)$ in the $\xi\eta$-plane follow suite, 
while keeping the distance between them a constant; namely $1$.

\includegraphics{g107.eps}

The envelope of such a segment is well-known as an \emph{astroid}\footnote{Not 
to be confused with {\emph{asteroid}}.}, which is described by the 
equation
$$ \left| \xi \right|^{2/3} + \left| \eta \right|^{2/3} = 1. $$

The image is at the point of tangency $\mathrm{C}$ of the segment 
$\overline{\mathrm{AB}}$ and the envelope of the moving segment, for 
it is the instant point of divergence of the neighboring rays.
Its corresponding point in the $\xi\eta$-plane is $(K^3, H^3)$.

Thus we can obtain the coordinates of image $(x_{\mathrm{C}}^{}, y_{\mathrm{C}}^{})$ 
from the relation
$$ \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
	\xi_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= \dfrac{x_{\mathrm{C}}^{}}{M} = K^3 = \dfrac{\alpha^3}{M^3},\\
	\eta_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= \dfrac{y_{\mathrm{C}}^{}}{N} = H^3 = \dfrac{\beta^3}{N^3}.
\end{aligned}
\right.$$
That is
$$ \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
	x_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= \dfrac{\alpha^3}{M^2},\\
	y_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= \dfrac{\beta^3}{N^2}=-\dfrac{k^3\alpha^3}{N^2}.
\end{aligned}
\right.$$

Using 
$$\sin\theta_2 = \dfrac{\alpha}{\sqrt{D^2+\alpha^2}},$$
we have
$$k = \dfrac{\sqrt{D^2-(n^2-1)\alpha^2}}{n\alpha},$$
and we can derive the position of the image as parametric functions w.r.t. $\alpha$:
$$ \left\{ 
\begin{aligned}
	x_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= (n^2-1)\dfrac{\alpha^3}{D^2},\\
	y_{\mathrm{C}}^{} &= -\dfrac{n^2}{D^2}\dfrac{\alpha^3}{n^3\alpha^3}\left\{ D^2-(n^2-1)\alpha^2 \right\}^{3/2}\\
	&=-\dfrac{D}{n}\left\{ 1-(n^2-1)\dfrac{\alpha^2}{D^2} \right\}^{3/2}.
\end{aligned}
\right.$$

\section{POV under water}
If the object is in the air, at height of D above the boundary, and the POV
is under water, the relative index of refraction is $1/n < 1$, and the similar reasoning
leads to the equation
$$ - \left| \xi \right|^{2/3} + \left| \eta \right|^{2/3} = 1, $$
with $\xi = \dfrac{x}{W} $ and $\eta = \dfrac{y}{Z}$, where
$W = \dfrac{nD}{\sqrt{1-n^2}}$ and $Z = nD$.

I could not find the name for this shape of the curve. The astroid is a member of the 
family of curves named \emph{superellipse}, which is defined by 
$$ \left| \xi \right|^{n} + \left| \eta \right|^{n} = 1. $$

Asteroid is the case where $n=2/3$. But as far as I know there's no name for the 
family of curves in the form
$$ \left| \xi \right|^{n} - \left| \eta \right|^{n} = \pm 1, $$
which could be named \emph{super-hyperbola}, although the repeating cognates may 
bother you\footnote{I might suggest \emph{superbola}.}.
